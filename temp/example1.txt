The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.    
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!



优美胜于丑陋明了胜于晦涩简洁胜于复杂复杂胜于凌乱扁平胜于嵌套间隔胜于紧凑可读性很重要
即便假借特例的实用性之名，也不可违背这些规则
不要忽略任何错误，除非你确定要这样做
当存在多种可能，不要尝试去猜测而是找唯一一个，最好是唯一一个明显的解决方案（虽然这方案一开始并非显而易见，除非你是荷兰人 —— 指 Python 之父 Guido）
做也许好过不做，但不假思索就动手还不如不做
如果你的方案很难解释，那一定不是个好主意如果你的方案容易解释，那可能是个好主意
命名空间是一种绝妙的理念，我们应当多加利用
